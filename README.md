Our study examines how credible and non-credible medical cues influence opinion change, within sources of the same category. By manipulating levels of expertise (working experience) and trustworthiness (rating) among fictional doctors, we isolate the relative impact of each dimension in a way that more closely resembles real-world evaluation of medical information persuasiveness.Additionally, we focus on the ERPs of negative feedback effects (congruent vs incongruent trials) depending on the source credibility.
